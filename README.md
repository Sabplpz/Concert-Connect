  ## Description

  Users are able to use the application to view upcoming concerts, ratings & reviews, and information about artists and venues all without having to sign in. If users choose to create an account, they can begin saving concerts to their own personal history, as well as adding friends to follow, and saving a list of their favorite artists and venues. Users can use our search feature to help them find the exact event they want! Keeping up with your own personal musicians has never been easier than with Concert:Connect!
